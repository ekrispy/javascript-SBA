# javascript-SBA
in order to get the desired results a function was used to loop around the learner assignments to first grab the id numbeers of the students
next was to get the grade for the specific assignnment of the learns by dividing the score thy recieved by the score of the total points of a particular assignment
and lastly we gathered the average of every on time/late assignment and added those scores and divided it by the total points of all assignments

the loops and function assiged to the javascript file had to have conditionals to return tre or false for certian parameters to ensue we hot the desidred result. 

a breakpoint was put on line 157 and commeted out as it was not something that was needed in the newDAta array

a try/catch method was used on lines 120-124
